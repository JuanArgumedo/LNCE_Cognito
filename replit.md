# Energy Communities Laboratory Application

## Overview

This is a web application for the "Laboratorio Nacional de Comunidades Energ√©ticas" (National Laboratory of Energy Communities), designed to manage information, monitoring, and processes for energy communities. The application provides a platform for community registration, administrative oversight, monitoring dashboards, and news management with a focus on promoting democratic participation in the energy sector transition.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui design system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state and React Context for authentication
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod schema validation
- **Design Pattern**: Component-based architecture with reusable UI components

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Architecture Pattern**: RESTful API with route-based organization
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with bcrypt for password hashing
- **File Uploads**: Multer middleware for handling document uploads
- **Middleware**: Custom authentication and authorization middleware with role-based access control

### Database Architecture
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Database**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Schema Design**: 
  - Users table with role-based access (administrador/comunidad)
  - Communities table for energy community registrations
  - News table for announcements and articles
  - Carousel slides table for landing page content
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema migrations and database management

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Strategy**: JWT-based authentication with role-based authorization
- **Roles**: Two primary roles - "administrador" (administrator) and "comunidad" (community)
- **Protection**: Route-level protection with middleware for API endpoints and component-level protection for frontend routes
- **Session Management**: Token storage in localStorage with automatic verification

### Application Structure
- **Monorepo Layout**: 
  - `/client` - React frontend application
  - `/server` - Express backend API
  - `/shared` - Shared TypeScript schemas and types
- **Component Organization**: UI components in `/components/ui` with business logic components in `/components`
- **Page Structure**: Role-based dashboards (admin, community, monitoring) with protected routes
